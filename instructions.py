'''Ever since you were small, you have loved the game ‘Rock / Paper / Scissors’ and you have decided
to create a custom version of this game. The rules are simple…
● Rock beats scissors
● Scissors beats paper
● Paper beats rock
Your game should allow users to play ‘Rock / Paper / Scissors’ against the computer. Below is a list
of features that you need to implement (you can add to this list if you’d like).
● During the session, the user enters their choice of rock / paper / scissors and it is compared
with the computer’s (randomly generated) choice
● Round and score mechanics need to be implemented.
o Users should be able to choose how many rounds they wish to play. They should be
able to choose an ‘infinite play’ mode where they type an exit code to quit rather
than playing a pre-determined number of rounds.
o Score could be based on how many rounds have been won / lost / drawn
o Games could be set up so that the winner is the first to win ‘x’ number of games
where ‘x’ is chosen by the user at the start of the game.

● End Game features
o Allow users to see their game history (users should be able to choose whether or not
to see this)
o Display game stats (eg: # of games won, lost and tied)'''
